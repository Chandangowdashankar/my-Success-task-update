this script is to verify the installtiop of azcopy cli in ubuntu if its not means it will install the az copy cli
and then using this script only we can achive the copy file from local to blob storage

in that step it will read 2 content 
1. local path of an file
2. blob storage file with auth key it should validate the authentication

or another way to achive this we need to re ad all the vaule 
like local path and blob path with another read like key to access
this code present in end of the line

script with blob url and access in one line
