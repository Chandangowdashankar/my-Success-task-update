----npm and node installtion on ubuntu----

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome’s JavaScript, 
designed to execute JavaScript code outside a web browser. 
It is generally used to build fast and scalable server-side and networking applications. 
npm is the default package manager for Node.js and also the name of the world’s largest software registry.


*Method 1*

****Installing Node.js and npm from the Ubuntu repository****

command--

sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y

At the time of writing this Notr, the Node.js version included in the default Ubuntu 22.04 repositories is v12.22.9 which is an older TLS version.
and npm version is 8.5.1

*Method 2*

****Installing Node.js and npm from NodeSource****

NodeSource is a company focused on providing enterprise-grade Node support. It maintains an APT repository containing multiple Node.js versions.
 Use this repository if your application requires a specific version of Node.js.

command--

sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
then
sudo apt install nodejs -y
( if u are facing any dpkg installtion problem use sudo apt autoclean and autoremove command)

like this way, we can replace specific version in curl command and do installtion of an nodejs and npm

Example -- for 16 version 
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
 Note- we need to change the curl command version

*Method 3*

****Installing Node.js and npm using NVM****

NVM (Node Version Manager) is a bash script that allows you to manage multiple Node.js versions on a per-user basis. 
With NVM you can install and uninstall any Node.js version that you want to use or test.

Visit the nvm GitHub repository page and copy either the curl or wget command to download and install the nvm script:

command--

wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

Note -- Do not use sudo as it will enable nvm for the root user.

* The script will clone the project’s repository from Github to the ~/.nvm directory:

command -- . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh

to check installtion of nvm

command -- nvm -v or nvm --version

command - nvm list-remote
--to check available node version

command - nvm install node
--To install the latest available version of Node.js

command - nvm install --lts
--To install the latest LTS version of Node.js

To install specific version of node 

command - nvm list-remote or nvm ls-remote
--to check available node version

command - nvm install 14.19.3
--we need to mentions specific version like 14.19.3 or 16.15.0 to get this version use above command 

command - nvm use 16.15.0

using this 3 method we can install npm and regarding node version
